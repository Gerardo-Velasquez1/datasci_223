# About me

Hello! I am a medicual student at UCSF. I am currently completing a masters program in clinical epidemiology in between my third and fourth year of medical school. My research project focuses on analyzing MRI and EEG data from comatose post-cardiac arrest patients in the neurological ICU.

**Goals for the Course**

 I have previous experience with statistical coding in R, and was introduced to programming in matlab and python upon joining my current lab. I am primarily interested in expanding my skillset in python to more efficient create and run MRI & EEG data processing pipelines and subsequent statistical analysis. Given I am working with EEG data, I am particularly interested in learning time series analysis and forecasting. Learning more sophisticated data visualization will also be immensely benificial to me.
